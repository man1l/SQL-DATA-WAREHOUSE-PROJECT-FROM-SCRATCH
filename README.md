# 🏗️ Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics Portfolio Project! 🚀  
This project showcases the end-to-end development of a modern data warehousing solution, using best practices in data engineering, data modeling, and analytics. It’s designed as a portfolio piece to demonstrate practical skills with real-world relevance.

## 🔍 Project Summary

This project walks through building a scalable data warehouse solution using the **Medallion Architecture**, focusing on:

- **Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer):** Loading raw data directly from CSV files into SQL Server.
- **Data Transformation (Silver Layer):** Cleaning, standardizing, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Data Modeling (Gold Layer):** Creating a business-friendly star schema for analytical queries and reporting.
